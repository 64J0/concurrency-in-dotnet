# Programs from "Concurrency in .NET"

This repository holds the programs from the book "Concurrency in .NET" and their benchmark, whenever I decided to add.

- [Quicksort](./quicksort/Program.fs)

## Run the benchmark

```bash
cd <project-directory>/
dotnet run -c Release
# run with `sudo` to give it high priority
```
